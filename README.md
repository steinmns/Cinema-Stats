# MovieSheet V2
Python based application to log and monitor viewing history

# Repository Format
- The repository is comprised of a main python file and three UI files for each of the screens in the interface. This will likely become more modular in the future, but it is not a current priority.

# Operation
- A full operation manual will be written once the interface is complete. The manual will also be available within the application.

# Development
- Currently working on the "Insights Page" Functionality
- Last completed: Help Menu

# Dependencies
- PyQt5
- Matplotlib
- QtAwesome

# Future Improvements/Ideas (Subject to change)
- Separate tabs for TV and Music
- Have a page for media coming out soon
- Badges
- Pull in media metadata for prettier display
- Data Importing Functionality
